Cloud Infrastructure & Continuous Deployment Case Study
Context
Manual is a healthtech company that provides digital solutions for patient care and clinical operations. To support our vertically integrated healthcare business (eCommerce, Clinicians and Pharmacy under one roof) we have developed three core business process applications:
an ecommerce system for patients and customer service (eShop system)
an EHR system for the doctors and clinicians (Doctor system)
and a dispensing and fulfilment system for the pharmacists and warehouse staff (Pharmacy system)

Here’s some high-level details on our infrastructure setup:
The backend systems are PHP based monoliths
The Shop & Doctor systems have public APIs
We have patient / doctor facing web apps (NextJS based) and mobile apps (React Native based) that communicate to the backend systems via the public APIs
The backend systems are hosted on AWS while the web apps are hosted on Vercel
There’s various AWS RDS datastores used by the eShop / Doctor / Pharmacy systems
Case Study
The case study has the goal to help you demonstrate your expertise in setting up a multi-cloud infrastructure (preferably for AWS+Vercel via Terraform, but GCP/Azure equivalents are also acceptable), automating deployments (preferably via GitHub Actions), and defining your monitoring strategy as well as the approach to hardening the security across the SDLC and the cloud infrastructure.

The target deliverables for this case study include a concise architecture + strategy document, and setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:
Architecture + Strategy Document
Outline the infrastructure’s high-level architecture and any decisions or tradeoffs made (as well as the rationale behind them)
Outline your recommendation for monitoring, alerting & SLOs and describe how you’d implement these using (one of) New Relic / CloudWatch / DataDog / Prometheus
Discuss how you’d use IaC for scalability and reproducibility across multiple environments (production/staging)
Describe how you will implement best security and compliance practices in the context of the healthcare domain
Outline your FinOps approach to optimising infrastructure costs
CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Define a CI/CD pipeline that covers an end2end process from linting all the way to deploying on ECS
Explain how you will monitor and handle failed deployments
Explain how you will incorporate best security practices into the pipeline and the SDLC process
Structure of our conversation
Based on your proposal for the infrastructure architecture, recommendations for monitoring, security and IaC, as well as the proposed e2e CI/CD pipeline, please be ready to discuss and deep dive into these topics during the Case Study Review round:
How would you stack rank & prioritise the various short / mid / long term improvements across infrastructure, monitoring, cost optimization, CI/CD and security?
What would you change when the usage / growth is doubling YoY?
How would you get buy-in from senior leadership and from the engineering teams for a major change being proposed? Please use your answer to [2] as an example
How would you measure the strategic impact of your work? What tactical metrics / KPIs would you rely on in the short term?
How will you partner with engineering teams to ensure that “secure by design” practices are incorporated into the SDLC?
